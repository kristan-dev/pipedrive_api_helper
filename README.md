# Pipedrive REST API Helper

(This is a work in progress)
This is a helper library for Pipedrive's rest API. At the moment, the helper is capable of Add, Update, and Delete for Products. Helper is also capable of Add Person, but is yet to support Edit and Delete. I will be adding those shortly.

## Getting Started

Install all libraries in requirements.txt

To install:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Prerequisites

Your Pipedrive API Token is required to use all the methods of this helper
